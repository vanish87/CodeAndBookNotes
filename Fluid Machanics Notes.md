### 1.1
* Definition of fluids

### 1.2
* Pressure:
  * normal stress: tao = Fn/A
  * shear stress:
  * Unit: Pa=>N/m2

### 1.4
* Density: p = m/V
* gama = pg

P = pRT for gas only

### 1.5
* Viscosity: resists deformation


## MPM
* F to refer to the Jacobian of the deformation mapping
  F is often simply called the deformation gradient.
