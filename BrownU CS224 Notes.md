1. solid angle: range of directions in 3D space, notation is *Omega*
2. Radiance: Energy flowing perpendicular to some measurement surface of area A, over a small range of directions Omega, over a small period of time from t0 to t1:  
E / (m(Omega)(t1 - t0)m(A)) => Radiance  
at each point x and for each direction omega, L(x,omega) is called *light field* or *radiance field*
